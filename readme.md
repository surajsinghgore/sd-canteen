# SD CANTEEN PHP

I created a website that helps both students and canteen vendors in college. Students can order items from their college canteen online, with the option for both online payment and cash on delivery. This system enables students to save a significant amount of time during peak hours when they would otherwise have to wait in line to purchase their items. The website allows students to place orders in advance, and they can then pick up their items by presenting a token ID. Additionally, students can explore all the items offered by the canteen and try out various canteen items.

Users can check the ratings of items, which are provided only by those who have actually consumed the items. Email notifications are sent to students to update them on their order status. Students also have the option to report abusive comments in the item rating sections.

The website uses data analysis techniques which help students to know which items are selling more, which are trending items, and which items are best-rated. The website only allows the use of Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo accounts to create an account on the college canteen website to handle fake user problems. The website also offers OTP verification to verify genuine users. It also allows students to reset their passwords if they forget them. The website disables cash on delivery for students' accounts if they do not collect their items from the canteen. All items on the website come from a database, and each item is fully dynamic.

Clients can update their general details, change passwords, track today's orders, track all past orders, and update their profile picture.

Features for vendors on this website:

Allow all college vendors, such as food stall vendors, coffee stall vendors, juice stall vendors, and drink vendors, to add their items to the website. Vendors can add, update, delete, and disable items. Each vendor has a unique password, ensuring they can only manage their own orders and not those of other vendors.

Real-time orders page: Vendors can access a page that displays orders in real-time with details like order token, order time, ordered items, quantity, etc. The real-time order panel also helps vendors track which orders are complete today, which are pending, which are rejected, and which orders are not on time.

Vendors can view graphs to analyze which items are selling more and which are not in demand. They can easily track the revenue generated monthly or yearly and compare order and payment records for three years. It also helps to track month-wise visits, new client registrations on the website, which browser is mainly used, total orders placed, all-time trending items on the website, total earnings, and the top 10 best food, coffee, juice, and drink items.

Graphs also help in order analysis with a maximum of three years so that progress of year-wise comparison on following conditions such as total orders, total complete orders, total rejected orders, total pending orders, etc.

The platform allows vendors to collect payments online using Paytm payment integration. The admin panel provides payment-related queries, allowing vendors to track payment status and transaction details such as bank name and order status. Graphs are available for year-wise comparisons, total earnings, online order initiation, revenue through online channels, and success or failure of payments, including cash-on-delivery transactions. Checksum techniques are employed to verify whether tampering has occurred in payments.

Vendors can easily track old payment records and manage their stocks by assessing the demand for their products.

Vendors have an order controller button that allows them to stop taking orders from clients by just toggling the order button. Vendors also have a comments management section, which helps them remove toxic text from review comment sections so that everyone can use the website with proper rules and regulations.
